The National Rail/TFL Rail:**\n\n* These trains connect Heathrow to central London stations like London Waterloo, Liverpool Street, and King's Cross.\n* Journey times vary depending on your destination, but generally take longer than the Heathrow Express or Piccadilly Line.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Purchase an Oyster card or use contactless payment for the cheapest fares on the Tube and buses. \n* Download the TFL (Transport for London) app for real-time journey planning and updates.\n* Allow extra time for travel, especially during rush hour.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need help planning your journey!",
