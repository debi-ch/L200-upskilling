      "response": "Okay, welcome to Tokyo! Get ready for an amazing experience. Here's a list of must-visit places for a first-time visitor, designed to give you a good mix of traditional and modern Tokyo:\n\n**For a Taste of Tradition:**\n\n*   **Senso-ji Temple (Asakusa):** Tokyo's oldest temple, a vibrant and bustling area with Nakamise-dori, a street lined with traditional shops selling crafts, souvenirs, and street food.  It's a great first immersion into Japanese culture. *Why go?* Iconic temple, lively atmosphere, photo opportunities galore, and delicious street food.\n*   **Meiji Jingu Shrine (Shibuya/Harajuku):** A peaceful oasis dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. Stroll through the serene forest leading to the shrine. A stark contrast to the surrounding bustling areas. *Why go?* Experience a Shinto shrine, find tranquility, and perhaps witness a traditional Japanese wedding.\n*   **Imperial Palace East Garden (Chiyoda):** The former site of Edo Castle. While you can't enter the main palace buildings, the East Garden is open to the public and offers beautiful landscapes and historical remnants. *Why go?* A glimpse into Japan's imperial history and lovely gardens.\n\n**For Modern Marvels and Pop Culture:**\n\n*   **Shibuya Crossing:** The world's busiest intersection! Experience the organized chaos as pedestrians surge across the street when the lights turn green. A must-do photo op. *Why go?* Iconic Tokyo experience, great for people-watching, and right next to the famous Hachiko statue.\n*   **Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden:** A beautiful blend of Japanese, English, and French garden styles. It offers a tranquil escape from the city's hustle and bustle. *Why go?* Relaxing atmosphere, stunning scenery, and diverse garden styles.\n*   **Harajuku (Takeshita Street):** The epicenter of youth fashion and quirky street style. Expect colorful shops, unique treats, and a vibrant atmosphere. *Why go?* Experience Tokyo's unique fashion scene, try interesting snacks, and people-watch.\n*   **Akihabara (Electric Town):** A paradise for anime, manga, gaming, and electronics enthusiasts. Discover themed cafes, arcades, and shops selling the latest gadgets. *Why go?* Immerse yourself in Japanese pop culture and find unique souvenirs.\n*   **Tokyo Skytree:** Offers panoramic views of the city. It's the tallest structure in Japan and a great way to get your bearings. *Why go?* Breathtaking views of Tokyo, a modern architectural marvel.\n\n**Other Great Options (depending on your interests/time):**\n\n*   **Ginza:** Upscale shopping district with department stores, boutiques, and fine dining.\n*   **Ueno Park:** Home to several museums (Tokyo National Museum, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Tokyo Science Museum), a zoo, and a beautiful pond.\n*   **TeamLab Borderless/Planets (Odaiba):** Immersive digital art museums (check availability and book in advance!).\n\n**Important Tips for First-Timers:**\n\n*   **Purchase a Suica or Pasmo card:** These rechargeable cards make navigating the public transportation system much easier.\n*   **Learn basic Japanese phrases:** While many people in tourist areas speak English, knowing some basic Japanese will be appreciated.\n*   **Carry cash:** While credit cards are becoming more widely accepted, many smaller shops and restaurants still prefer cash.\n*   **Be mindful of etiquette:**  Avoid talking loudly on trains, don't eat while walking (except in designated areas like street food stalls), and learn basic bowing etiquette.\n*   **Wear comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking!\n*   **Plan your itinerary, but be flexible:**  Tokyo is a vast city, so it's good to have a plan, but leave room for spontaneity.\n*   **Enjoy the food!** Tokyo is a culinary paradise. Be adventurous and try new things.\n\nTo help me customize this list for you, tell me:\n\n*   **How many days will you be in Tokyo?**\n*   **What are your specific interests (e.g., history, food, anime, art, nature)?**\n*   **What's your budget like (e.g., budget-friendly, mid-range, luxury)?**\n\nHave a fantastic trip!\n",
